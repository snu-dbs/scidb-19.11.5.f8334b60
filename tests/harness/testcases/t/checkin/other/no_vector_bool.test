# SDB-1929.  The std::vector<bool> class is problematic.  Google
# "vector bool problems" to understand why.  There is never a good
# reason to use it.
#
# This test makes sure it doesn't get reintroduced, making exceptions
# for a few places in the code base where it is mentioned in
# comments.  Repeat: don't use vector<bool>.
