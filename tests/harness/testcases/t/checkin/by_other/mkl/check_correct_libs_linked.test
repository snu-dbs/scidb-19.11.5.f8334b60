# 2) must not be linked to liblapack
# 3) must be linked to libmkl_rt.so which must resolve correctly

#
# the same rules apply to mpi_slave_scidb
# however, it does contain links to libblas and liblapack through scalapack dependency
# so we will have to have another test for it to make sure
# that lib{blas,lapack} are never loaded because of libmkl_rt resolving first
# see ScaLAPACKFlopsTest.test which tries to determine that by performance
