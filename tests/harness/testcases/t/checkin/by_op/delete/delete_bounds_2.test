# SDB-6210: delete() should update dimension bounds in catalog

# Trickier than delete_bounds_1; here we make a cube and delete
# regions, sometimes by attribute value and sometimes by dimension
# range.  Each cell <a, b, c> happens to have the same values as its
# coordinates [x, y, z].

--setup

create array CUBE <a:int64, b:int64, c:int64>[x=0:19:0:5; y=0:19:0:5; z=0:19:0:5]
create array CUBE_BUILDER <a:int64>[x=0:19:0:5; y=0:19:0:5; z=0:19:0:5]
store(apply(build(CUBE_BUILDER, x), b, y, c, z), CUBE)
