The null expression term should have no effect.
{i} val
{0} 1
{1} 3
{2} 5
{3} 7
{4} 9
{5} 11

{i} val
{0} 1
{1} 3
{2} 5

These yields nothing, no comparison (even !=) vs. null should work.
{i} val

{i} val

{i} val

{i} val

{i} val

{i} val

{i} val

These too: all empty.
{i} val

{i} val

{i} val

{i} val

Check weird non-storing filter behavior.  Should yield nothing.
